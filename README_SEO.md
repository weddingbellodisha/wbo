## 🆘 Troubleshooting Quick Guide

### Issue: Files show 404 error
**Solution**: Make sure files are in root directory (`/robots.txt`, not `/public/robots.txt`)

### Issue: .htaccess causes errors
**Solution**: If using non-Apache hosting, you may not need it. Check with your host.

### Issue: Schema markup not validating
**Solution**: Use https://validator.schema.org to find errors. Usually just missing commas or quotes.

### Issue: Search Console says "not indexed"
**Solution**: Wait 1-2 weeks. Then submit for indexing manually in Search Console.
